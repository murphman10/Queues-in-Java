# Queues-in-Java
This project involves transforming a queuing program written in C++ to a Java equivalent.

Convert the attached C++ code to working Java code.  Don't be afraid to make changes to it, but be judicious in the change that you make.  
This assignment is not about re-writing or improving this code, but rather about recognizing the differences between C++ and Java, 
and making the necessary coding changes to accommodate how Java does things.
